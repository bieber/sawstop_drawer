This is a simple drawer that should fit in the ends of the fence
tubing on Sawstop PCS and ICS saws with the T Glide fence.  You can
just pop the end cap off of the tube and this should fit right in.

Pretty much every aspect of this is customizable, and it might even be
possible to adapt it to fence tubes for other saws (I have no idea if
any other saw uses a similar tube for the fence).  Some particularly
interesting parameters:

* The `SIDE` parameter will mirror the model if you set it to "right",
  enabling you to place the drawer in the right side of the tube.

* You won't want to change the width or height for Sawstop saws, but
  you can change the `LENGTH` at will: the only limit is the size of
  your printer's bed and the length of your fence tube.

* You can add dividers by using the `VERTICAL_DIVIDERS`,
  `HORIZONTAL_DIVIDERS`, and `DIVIDER_HEIGHT` parameters.  The first
  two parameters are lists of positions in mm where the horizontal
  and/or vertical dividers will be added, and the third sets the
  height of the dividers.
